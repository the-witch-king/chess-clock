### Always appreciative of feedback!

This was my first non-tutorial stab at react. I tried to do everything as functionally as possible, and with as little mutation as possible. I haven't really made
anything under those constraints before in the web. Please keep that in mind, but otherwise, feel free to absolutely tear this apart. I'm all ears for any suggestions,
and truly appreciate any feedback anyone is willing to give me.
